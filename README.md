# **snakes_on_planes_redux**
Project Initiated: 2021-02-19<br>
Updated: 2021-02-20

## **Project Description**
This project will use allow the user to "buy" snakes for their planes.  New Snakes can be added, edited, deleted, and restocked.  This is an updated version of snakes_on_planes that incorporates Redux. 

Coding Prompt:

This is the second part of a two-section project. At the end of the last section's independent project, you built a tap room using local and shared state in React. For this independent project, you will update your application to incorporate Redux.  The first part of the project and its prompt can be found [here](https://github.com/RMGit-it/snakes_on_planes).

Before getting started, clone or fork the repo of the project you completed at the end of the last section.

Here are the requirements for the refactor:

* Shared state in your application should be handled by Redux.
* All reducers should be tested thoroughly, and all tests must be passing.
* Action creators and constants should be used.

## **Required for Use**
* A browser that can run HTML5 is required.
* Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
