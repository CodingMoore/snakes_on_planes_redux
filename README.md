# **snakes_on_planes**
Project Initiated: 2021-02-12<br>
Updated: 2021-02-16

## **Project Description**
This project will use allow the user to "buy" snakes for their planes.  New Snakes can be added, edited, deleted, and restocked.

Coding Prompt:

This will be a two-week project. Spend today building a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs. This could also be a soda fountain __or another kind of tracker__ - as long as you're able to track the remaining amount and meet the objectives, __you can be creative with this prompt.__

Before getting started, plan out your application and draw a component tree or component diagram that shows the structure of your components. This is a requirement for the project and should be included in your README. You may draw the structure on a piece of paper and take a picture of it or use an application like https://www.draw.io/.

Here are some user stories to get you started. The application should have the following functionality:

* As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.

## **Required for Use**
A browser that can run HTML5 is required.
## **Installation Instructions**
**Option 1** (direct download)
1) Copy and paste the following GitHub project link into your web browser's url bar and hit enter/return. https://github.com/RMGit-it/snakes_on_planes
2) Download a .zip copy the repository by clicking on the large green "Code" button near the upper right corner of the screen.
3) Right click the .zip file and extract(unzip) it's contents.
4) Open the unzipped folder/files using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or similar source code editing program.  Install all required dependencies from the package.JSON folder, and then build the program.  If you are using Node Package Manager, first navigate to the root directory of the project in your console.  You can then type the following commands to install and build the program.

**Option 2** (via git console/terminal)
1) Open your Git enabled terminal/console and navigate to a directory that you wish to download this project to.
2) Type the following line of code into your terminal/console to automatically download the project to your current direcory and hit return/enter

    <code>git clone https://github.com/RMGit-it/snakes_on_planes</code><br>

3) Once the project has finished downloading, navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal/console, and type <code>code .</code> and then hit return/enter.

    The project should automatically launch using your default source code editor.

4) Install all required dependencies from the package.JSON folder, and then build the program.  If you are using Node Package Manager, first navigate to the root directory of the project in your console.  You can then type the following commands to install and build the program.

    <code>npm install</code>
